## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saber0722/IMDB-Dataset-Sentimental-Analysis.git
cd IMDB-Dataset-Sentimental-Analysis
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On Unix or MacOS:
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📊 Training the Model

* **Notebook:** `notebooks/train_model.ipynb`

  Running this notebook will:

  * Download and cache the IMDB dataset into the `data/` directory.
  * Preprocess the data.
  * Fine-tune a BERT model for sentiment classification.

**Note:** The dataset and tokenizer will be cached in the `data/` folder upon execution.

---

## ⚠️ Hardware Considerations

* The model was trained using a GPU, which significantly reduced training time.
* **If you're using a CPU**, be aware that training will be considerably slower and more resource-intensive.

  * To mitigate this:

    * **Reduce the maximum sequence length** from 128 to 8 or 4.
    * **Decrease the batch size** from 8 to 2 or even 1.

Adjust these parameters in the training notebook to accommodate your hardware capabilities.

---

## 🌐 Running the Streamlit App

The `app.py` file launches a Streamlit web application for sentiment prediction.

To run the app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

**Please Note:**

* The initial loading time may be longer due to the size of the BERT model.
* Ensure that the trained model is available in the `outputs/` directory before running the app.
